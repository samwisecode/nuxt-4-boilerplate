# Lank Dev Nuxt UI Starter

# Create a new Nuxt project with Nuxt UI. This template extends the default Nuxt UI template with some additional configurations.

Note: If you're using pnpm, ensure that you either set `shamefully-hoist=true` in your `.npmrc` file or install `tailwindcss` in your project's root directory.

```bash
npx nuxi@latest init my-app -t ui
```
